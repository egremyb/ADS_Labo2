## Navigation into the Unix manual
#### What are the nine sections of Unix manual ?
By using the command `man man`, the sections are :
1. Executable programs or shell commands
1. System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
1. Library calls (functions within program libraries)
1. Special files (usually found in /dev)
1. File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
1. Games
1. Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
1. System administration commands (usually only for root)
1. Kernel routines [Non standard]
