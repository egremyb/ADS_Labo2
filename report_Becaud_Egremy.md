## Absolute and relative path
#### Absolute path
Absolute path points to a specific file or directory location from the root directory `/`.

Absolute path to ssh : `/usr/bin/ssh`

#### Relative path
Relative path points to a specific file or directory like an absolute path but it does not begin from the root directory.

Here are `relative paths` to ssh from their current directory.
1. /usr/`bin/ssh`
1. /usr/bin/`ssh`
1. /usr/share`/../bin/ssh`
1. /usr/local/bin`/../../bin/ssh`
