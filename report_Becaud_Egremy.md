## Pagination tool `less`

1. **Which key is used to reach the start of the file ?**

  `g`

2. **Which key is used to reach the end of the file ?**

  `G`

3. **How can you search for the pattern _admin_ ?**

  `/admin`

4. **How do you go to the next occurrence ?**

  `/`

5. **What is the effect of adding _-i_ before the search ? And _-i_ repeatedly ? Starting at the beginning of the file, search for the pattern _bob_.**

  Adding _-i_ make the search case insensitive. By adding it multiple times, it acts like a switch and change the sensitivity to the case each time.

6. **What happen if you open :**

  1. **A compressed file like `/usr/share/doc/bash/INTRO.gz` ?**

    A message tells us that the file might be a binary one and then asks us if we want to see it anyway. In that case, it proceeds to display the content of the file into ASCII characters that doesn't make understandable sentences (a lot of non-alphabetical characters might be displayed). The content of the file isn't understandable for a human in this state.

  2. **A compressed archive like `/usr/share/doc/apg/php.tar.gz` ?**

    Same as the previous answer.
